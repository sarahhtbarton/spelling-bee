This script will generate a number of words with a specified word length.

The purpose of this is to make it easy to generate words for use in
a spelling contest.

This script requires word.txt which is a list of over 65,000 words.
You may find a better quality set of words (or dictionary) to use
as long as you name it words.txt and place it in the same directory as
spell_bee.py

PS  I'm a noob and it probably shows, please feel free to correct
me but please be nice  :)
